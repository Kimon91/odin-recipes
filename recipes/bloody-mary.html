    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>The Bloody Mary is one of the world’s best-known cocktails, prized for its ability to jumpstart even the
        groggiest of mornings. Its origins aren’t exactly clear, but one likely backstory points to the mid-1930s and
        Fernand “Pete” Petiot, a bartender at King Cole Bar at the St. Regis hotel in New York City. Other sources
        credit American actor George Jessel, who was said to have favored the combination of vodka and tomato juice as
        customer of New York City’s 21 Club, though Petiot disputed Jessel's contributions to the creation of drink.</p>
